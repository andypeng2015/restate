## RT0005

Failed opening RocksDB, because the db file is currently locked.  
This happens usually if another process still holds the lock.

Suggestions:

* Check no other Restate process is running and using the same db file.
* Configure a different RocksDB storage directory via `worker.storage_rocksdb.path`.

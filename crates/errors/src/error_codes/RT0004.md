## RT0004

Failed starting process because it could not bind to configured address.
This happens usually if another process has already bound to this address.

Suggestions:

* Select an address that is free.
* Stop the process that has bound to the specified address.
* Make sure you have the permissions to bind to the configured port. Some operating systems require admin/root privileges to bind to ports lower than 1024.
